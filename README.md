### Ruby on Rails test work

Here is the test Ruby on Rails application with two models: `Company` and `Employee`. There is one-to-many relation between them.


### Your task

The task is to extend models validation with additional context `:strict`, and also make `employee.valid?` to validate nested company too.

The work was started in `strict_validation` branch. There is implemented test case, but it fails.

Please, make the test green.
